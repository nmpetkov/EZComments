EZComments commenting system for PostNuke

Requirements
------------
- PostNuke 0.8 or later


Installation
------------
Installation of the module follows the same procedure as other PostNuke modules. Copy the akismet directory
to your modules directory (modules/). From the modules admin panel regenerate the modules list then initialize
and activate the akismet module.

Usage
-----
EZComments is a display hook module and requires activating for each module that you wish to enable commenting on.

For example. 

To enable commenting on news articles go to Administration->System->Modules. Locate the news module entry and 
click the hooks link. Check the EZComments option and submit the form. Now when a news article is displayed comments
and a comment form will be displayed 

Integrating EZComments into any module:
---------------------------------------
If you want to make a module commentable (as module developer for example) integrate these codelines into your template
at the place where you want to have your comment function.

1. Step: Generate the return url. EZComments has to know from which page the comment was sent from. This is an example
of the MyProfile profile module

<!--[pnmodurl modname="MyProfile" func="display" uid=$uid pluginname="EZComments" order="1" assign="viewUrl"]-->

2. Step. Call the hook: This is also an example from the MyProfile module. module has to be 
the commentable module, returnurl is the url we constructed one line above this text and 
owneruid should be the owner of the displayed content. This (owneruid) is very 
importan because it allows the content owner (weblog owner, gallery owner, profile 
owner) to moderate the comments other users submitted for his content. 
Otherwise the admin (you?) have to moderate everything by hand!

<!--[pnmodcallhooks hookobject=item hookaction=display hookid=$uid module="MyProfile" returnurl=$viewUrl owneruid=$uid implode=false]-->
<!--[$hooks.EZComments]-->
