       Migration plugin functionality
       Available now is a plugin to migrate from the original NS-Comments
       Module to EZComments

       Cleanup functionality to erase 
       This is needed after the deletion of a module. EZComments does not
       recognize this deletion. With the Cleanup you can wipe out all comments
       for the module in question.

       Comments can be displayed threaded (depending on the template)

       Comments can have their own subject (depending on the template)

       Templates uses .htm as suffix
       Templates uses <!--[ and ]--> as smarty delimiters
       Added a lot of Templates in the MoreTemplates directory

       Added a pager to the admin panel so you do not see all comments on 
       one page (important for sites with lot of comments)

       Transform hooks
       EZComments calls transform hooks. The hooks must be activated for
       the "parent" module (say, you want EZComments for News, so you must
       activete the transform hooks for News, not for EZComments)

       A lot of new translation variables.
