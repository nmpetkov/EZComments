Things left to be done:

 - Providing delete hooks.
   When you delete an item, the comments remain orphaned

 - Finding a soultion for deleting threaded comments
   When a comment is deleted now, its childen remain orphaned
   (they can be seen by using a "flat" template, though)

 - Making a template for delete confirmation
   I guess there is just an additional template (Default_delete) 
   needed.

 - Making a template for modifiying comments
   The APIs are already there, but the template is not.

 - Make a switch in Admin Panel to allow/deny users to delete or
   modify their own comments

 - make a search plugin

 - make blocks

 - find bugs ;-)
